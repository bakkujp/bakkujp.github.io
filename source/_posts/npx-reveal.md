## What is npx?

npx is a package management tool as npm but simplified number of things as I will list below.

- Start server with different Node.js
- Using locally installed tools
- Execute a command that no need globally.

## Start server with different Node.js

```
$ npx node@6 -v
```

```
$ npx -p node@6
```

## Using locally installed tools

## Execute a command that no need globally.
